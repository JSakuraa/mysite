          My name is Justin Nappi, I started teaching myself development and design when I was twelve and now I am
          studying computer science at the University of Connecticutâ€™s School of Engineering. In addition to my passion
          for development and design, I am an entrepreneur and a self-proclaimed video game enthusiast.
        </p>
        <p>
          My latest venture is a startup called SmartCards. Myself and two other UConn students saw the opportunity to
          utilize augmented reality to create a more interactive and engaging way to learn. We were focused on creating
          a more inclusive solution, especially for students with neurodiversities. SmartCards will use mobile augmented
          reality, combined with computer vision in order to allow students to utilize hand gestures and hand tracking
          to interact with their learning like never before.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, if I had to put my goal into one sentence, it would be: I want to utilize my passion for technology
          to create a more inclusive and fun world for everyone. As broad as that goal may be, it is what motivates me
          to continue developing my skills every day.
        </p>

          I have experience using Git, Python, C#, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SCSS. I am also trained in Windows 10 and
          ChromeOS. More recently I have began learning blockchain programming as well as machine learning.
